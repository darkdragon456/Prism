# PRISM EVENTS — Minimal React Frontend

This repository contains a small Vite + React scaffold for the PRISM EVENTS landing page.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the printed `localhost` URL in your browser.

Notes:
- The app uses an Unsplash image for the background. Replace the URL in `src/styles.css` if you prefer a local image (put it into `public/` or import it in React).
- To build a production bundle: `npm run build` and `npm run preview` to preview.
